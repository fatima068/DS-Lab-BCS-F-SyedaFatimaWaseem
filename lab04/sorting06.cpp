// in order of the time they are to be shipped out. Thus, the cost of compares is very low relative to 
// the cost of exchanges (move the crates). The warehouse is nearly full: there is extra space 
// sufficient to hold any one of the crates, but not two. Which sorting method should the clerk use? 
// Implement this question via a user generated array?
